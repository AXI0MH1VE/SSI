# Roadmap to AxiomHive v3.0: Enterprise-Grade Sovereign Intelligence

Your proposed enhancements form the four pillars of the v3.0 evolution. Here is the architectural plan to implement them.

## 1. Enhanced Local Model with ONNX Runtime

**Objective:** Replace the rule-based model with a sophisticated, pre-trained neural network that maintains high performance on CPUs and preserves determinism.

**Implementation Plan:**

- **Model Selection & Conversion:** A compact, pre-trained language model (e.g., a distilled version of a larger transformer like MobileBERT or a specialized model from the Hugging Face Hub) will be selected. It will be converted to the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format, a hardware-agnostic standard.

- **Quantization:** The model will be quantized (e.g., from 32-bit floating-point to 8-bit integer precision). This drastically reduces its size and CPU computation requirements with minimal impact on accuracy.

- **Python Handler Integration:** The axiom_model_handler.py will be updated to use the onnxruntime library. This library is highly optimized for cross-platform CPU inference and offers controls to ensure deterministic execution by disabling intra-op parallelism and setting fixed seeds.

**Result:** A model with significantly more powerful reasoning capabilities than the v2.0 rule-based system, yet still capable of running offline with millisecond latency on a standard laptop.

## 2. Vector Search for Grounding (Sovereign RAG)

**Objective:** Upgrade the grounding mechanism from keyword matching to a semantic search system for more accurate and context-aware citation retrieval.

**Implementation Plan:**

- **Embedding Generation:** The setup.sh script will be augmented with a one-time process. It will use a lightweight sentence-transformer model (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to read the knowledge_base.json and generate vector embeddings for each content block. These embeddings will be stored locally in an indexed file.

- **Vector Search Integration:** The axiom_model_handler.py will, upon receiving a prompt, first generate an embedding for the prompt itself. It will then use a high-speed, local vector search library like faiss-cpu to perform a cosine similarity search against the pre-computed knowledge base index. The top-matching text snippets will be passed to the ONNX model as context.

**Result:** A true Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that is fully offline and sovereign. The model's responses will be grounded in a much deeper, semantic understanding of the local knowledge base.

## 3. Full Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Implementation

**Objective:** Implement the placeholder authentication layer with a production-grade SSI verification mechanism based on W3C standards.

**Implementation Plan:**

- **Middleware in Node.js:** A new authentication middleware will be added in server.js before the main /ask route handler.

- **Verifiable Credential Check:** This middleware will expect an Authorization header containing a Verifiable Presentation (VP) in JWT format. It will use a library like didkit-js to:
  - Decode the VP.
  - Resolve the Decentralized Identifier (DID) of the issuer.
  - Verify the cryptographic signature of the credential.

- **Access Control:** Only requests with a valid, verifiable credential from a trusted issuer will be allowed to proceed to the model handler.

**Result:** A zero-trust API where access is not based on secrets like API keys but on provable, decentralized identity, fulfilling the "Sovereign Verifiability" objective.

## 4. Concurrent Request Handling and Worker Pooling

**Objective:** Evolve the system from handling single-threaded requests to managing concurrent workloads efficiently, preventing resource exhaustion.

**Implementation Plan:**

- **Worker Pool:** Instead of spawning a new Python process for every request, the server.js application will initialize a fixed-size pool of axiom_model_handler.py worker processes at startup. The size of the pool will be configurable, defaulting to number of CPU cores - 1.

- **Job Queue:** An in-memory queue will be implemented in Node.js. Incoming requests to /ask will be added to this queue.

- **Dispatch Logic:** The main server process will act as a dispatcher, handing off jobs from the queue to the next available worker in the pool. This prevents the system from being overloaded by a sudden burst of requests and ensures predictable performance under load.

**Result:** A robust, production-ready service that can handle multiple simultaneous users or clients, maximizing throughput without compromising system stability.
