## Overview

The Government Identity Connector provides secure, standards-compliant self-sovereign identity capabilities for federal, state, and local government agencies. This module enables citizen identity verification, government employee credentials, contractor management, and inter-agency data sharing while maintaining the highest security standards required for government operations.

### Market Specifics

#### Target Markets
- **Federal Agencies**: Citizen services, employee credentials, security clearances
- **State & Local Government**: DMV, vital records, licensing, permits
- **Defense & Intelligence**: Classified access, personnel security, mission systems
- **Law Enforcement**: Officer credentials, evidence chain of custody, inter-agency coordination
- **Public Services**: Benefits administration, social services, tax systems
- **Elections**: Voter registration, poll worker credentials, ballot tracking

#### Key Use Cases
1. **Citizen Digital Identity**: Universal government ID for all public services
2. **Security Clearance Management**: Personnel security and access authorization
3. **Government Employee Credentials**: CAC/PIV card integration and authentication
4. **Contractor Verification**: Background checks, clearances, and access control
5. **Benefits Administration**: Social Security, Medicare, veteran benefits
6. **Inter-Agency Data Sharing**: Secure information exchange between agencies
7. **Voter Identity**: Registration verification and election integrity
8. **License & Permit Management**: Driver's licenses, professional licenses, permits

#### Regulatory Alignment
- **Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM)**: Government-wide identity framework
- **FedRAMP (High)**: Cloud security authorization for federal use
- **NIST 800-63-3**: Digital identity guidelines (IAL3, AAL3, FAL3)
