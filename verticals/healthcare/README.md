## Overview

The Healthcare Identity Connector provides HIPAA-compliant self-sovereign identity capabilities for healthcare organizations, providers, patients, and payers. This module enables secure, privacy-preserving credential management for medical records, provider credentials, patient identity, and healthcare transactions.

### Market Specifics

#### Target Markets
- **Hospitals & Health Systems**: Patient identity, provider credentials, staff access
- **Insurance Payers**: Member verification, claims authorization, provider networks
- **Pharmacies**: Prescription verification, controlled substance tracking
- **Telemedicine Platforms**: Remote patient verification, provider licensing
- **Clinical Research**: Patient consent, trial enrollment, data sharing
- **Medical Device Manufacturers**: Device registration, patient monitoring

#### Key Use Cases
1. **Patient Identity Management**: Universal patient identifier across care settings
2. **Provider Credentialing**: Medical licenses, board certifications, DEA numbers
3. **Health Information Exchange**: Consent-based data sharing between organizations
4. **Prescription Drug Monitoring**: Controlled substance prescriber verification
5. **Clinical Trial Enrollment**: Patient consent and eligibility credentials
6. **Telehealth Authorization**: Remote care provider verification

#### Regulatory Alignment
- **HIPAA Privacy Rule**: Protected Health Information (PHI) safeguards
- **HIPAA Security Rule**: Administrative, physical, and technical safeguards
- **HITECH Act**: Electronic health record requirements
- **21st Century Cures Act**: Patient access and interoperability
- **FDA 21 CFR Part 11**: Electronic records and signatures
- **DEA Regulations**: Controlled substance prescriber verification
- **State Medical Board Requirements**: Provider licensing and credentialing

## Security & Privacy Features

### HIPAA Safeguards
- **Administrative**: Access controls, workforce training, audit controls
- **Physical**: Facility access controls, workstation security
- **Technical**: Encryption (AES-256), access controls, audit logs

### PHI Protection
- **Minimum Necessary Rule**: Selective disclosure of PHI
- **De-identification**: Safe harbor and expert determination methods
- **Encryption**: PHI encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Logging**: All PHI access logged for audit

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- Prove eligibility without revealing diagnosis
- Verify insurance without exposing policy details
- Confirm age without revealing date of birth

---

## Compliance & Auditing

### HIPAA Audit Trail
All operations logged with:
- User/system identifier
- PHI accessed (minimal logging to protect privacy)
- Date/time of access
- Purpose of use
- Authorization basis

### Required Retention Periods
- **Patient Records**: 6 years from last patient encounter
- **Audit Logs**: 6 years
- **Consent Records**: Duration of consent + 6 years
- **Provider Credentials**: Until expiration + 2 years

### Business Associate Agreements (BAA)
Required for all covered entities and business associates handling PHI.
