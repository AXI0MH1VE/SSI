- Value Capture: Transaction revenue, enterprise SaaS, module marketplaces for KYC, AML, etc.

## 2. ARTIFACTS/ (The "What")
- Source code: Production-level credential wallet, multi-chain modules, >95% coverage.
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform/K8s manifests for instant global deployment.
- API Kits: REST/gRPC endpoints for banks/governments, formal schemas.
- CI/CD: End-to-end reproducible deployment workflows.
- Benchmark Suite: Latency, throughput, compliance proofs.

## 3. PRINCIPLES.md (The "How")
- Observation: Centralized identity is brittle.
- Principle: Stateless sovereignty drives resilience.
- Implication: SSI as global digital utility for everyone, not a vendor feature.

## 4. DEPLOYMENT.md (The "Now")

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/AXI0MH1VE/SSI
  cd SSI
  make install
  make test
  make deploy-multichain
  ```
- Environment variables and rollbacks.
- Cost/latency via Prometheus log.

## 5. VALIDATION/ (The "Proof")
- schemas/: JSON Schemas.
- ci/: All integration tests.
- integrity_attestation.txt: SHA-256 hash of UDP sections; declaration of Alexis Adams Primacy Manifested.
