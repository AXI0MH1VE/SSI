# Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the architecture of the SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity) system.

## System Components

### Core Modules

#### Identity Management
- Handles creation and management of decentralized identifiers (DIDs)
- Manages cryptographic key pairs for identity verification
- Supports multiple DID methods and standards

#### Credential Issuance
- Issues verifiable credentials to identity holders
- Implements W3C Verifiable Credentials standard
- Provides credential schema validation

#### Credential Verification
- Verifies the authenticity of presented credentials
- Validates cryptographic proofs and signatures
- Checks credential status (revocation, expiration)

### Data Layer

#### Storage
- Encrypted local storage for private keys and credentials
- Distributed ledger integration for public DID documents
- IPFS support for decentralized credential schemas

#### Blockchain Integration
- Smart contracts for credential registry
- Anchoring DID operations on distributed ledgers
- Support for multiple blockchain networks

## Architecture Patterns

### Decentralization
- No central authority for identity management
- Peer-to-peer credential exchange
- User-controlled data sovereignty

### Security
- End-to-end encryption for all communications
- Zero-knowledge proof implementations
- Secure key management and rotation

### Interoperability
- W3C DID and VC standards compliance
- Support for multiple credential formats
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Data Flow

1. **Identity Creation**: User generates DID and key pair locally
2. **Credential Issuance**: Issuer creates and signs credential
3. **Credential Storage**: User stores credential in encrypted wallet
4. **Credential Presentation**: User presents credential to verifier
5. **Verification**: Verifier validates credential and issuer signature

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Languages**: JavaScript/TypeScript, Python
- **Cryptography**: libsodium, Web Crypto API
- **Storage**: IndexedDB, IPFS
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Hyperledger Indy
- **Standards**: W3C DID Core, W3C Verifiable Credentials

## Deployment

### Client-Side
- Web application (PWA)
- Mobile applications (iOS/Android)
- Browser extensions

### Server-Side
- Agent services for credential issuance
- Resolver services for DID resolution
- Optional backup and recovery services

## Scalability Considerations

- Horizontal scaling of agent services
- Caching layer for DID resolution
- Batch processing for credential operations
- Load balancing for high-availability

## Future Enhancements

- Advanced privacy features (selective disclosure)
- Enhanced revocation mechanisms
- Integration with additional blockchain networks
- Improved user experience and onboarding
