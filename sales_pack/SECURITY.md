# Security Policy

## Threat Model

### Assets
- **Source Code**: Application code and intellectual property
- **User Data**: Authentication credentials, personal information, and session data
- **System Infrastructure**: Deployment environments, CI/CD pipelines, and dependencies
- **Communication Channels**: Data in transit between components

### Threat Actors
- **External Attackers**: Malicious actors attempting unauthorized access
- **Malicious Insiders**: Compromised or rogue internal users
- **Automated Threats**: Bots, scrapers, and automated exploitation tools
- **Supply Chain Attackers**: Compromised dependencies or third-party services

### Attack Vectors
- **Code Injection**: SQL injection, XSS, command injection
- **Authentication Bypass**: Credential stuffing, session hijacking, privilege escalation
- **Dependency Exploitation**: Vulnerable third-party libraries and packages
- **Configuration Errors**: Exposed secrets, overly permissive access controls
- **Social Engineering**: Phishing, pretexting targeting maintainers or users

### Security Controls
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Multi-factor authentication and role-based access control
- **Encryption**: TLS for data in transit, encryption at rest for sensitive data
- **Dependency Management**: Regular updates and vulnerability scanning
- **Security Monitoring**: Logging, alerting, and incident response procedures

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send details to security@[domain] (replace with actual contact)
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Report a vulnerability" button in the Security tab
3. **Private Disclosure**: Contact maintainers directly through verified channels

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:
- Type of vulnerability
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if available)
- Impact assessment
- Suggested remediation (if available)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of report
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days with preliminary assessment
- **Resolution Target**: Critical issues within 30 days, others within 90 days
- **Public Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is deployed

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials to the repository
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper input validation and output encoding
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Conduct peer review for all security-sensitive changes

### Dependency Management
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review dependency licenses and security advisories
- Use lock files to ensure reproducible builds
- Scan for vulnerabilities using automated tools

### Development Environment
- Use secure development environments
- Enable 2FA on all accounts
- Keep development tools and IDEs updated
- Use GPG signing for commits (recommended)

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as:
- **Critical**: Immediate patch release
- **High**: Patch release within 7 days
- **Medium**: Included in next minor release
- **Low**: Included in next major release

Subscribe to security advisories to stay informed about vulnerabilities and patches.

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate the security research community's efforts in responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities. Contributors who report valid security issues will be acknowledged in release notes (unless they prefer to remain anonymous).
